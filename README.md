Registering a new account is the first step for unregistered users to gain access to the application. Users are required to provide a username, password, and optionally an email address during the registration process. To maintain security, we enforce certain criteria for usernames and passwords, such as minimum length and complexity requirements. Upon successful registration, users are either redirected to the login page or provided with a confirmation message, depending on the implementation.

Once registered, users can log in to the application using their chosen username and password. The login process involves validating the provided credentials against secure in-memory storage. Passwords are hashed using a one-way cryptographic algorithm, such as bcrypt, with a random salt for added security. Successful login establishes a user session for the current application instance, allowing users to access their designated dashboard or home page.

To enhance security further, we implement measures to limit the number of consecutive login failures. After a certain threshold, users are prompted with a message indicating the remaining attempts and suggesting re-registration. Additionally, informative error messages are displayed for invalid username or password inputs, helping users troubleshoot login issues more effectively.

From a technical standpoint, our implementation follows the principles of Onion Architecture, with the User entity and related logic residing in the Domain layer. The Application Service layer handles user registration and login functionalities, while the Infrastructure layer utilizes in-memory storage for storing hashed credentials. Password hashing and validation are crucial aspects of our implementation, ensuring that user passwords are securely stored and authenticated.

Setting up and running the application is a straightforward process. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, users can build and run the application using provided scripts or commands. Once the application is running, users can access the login and registration pages to experience the functionalities firsthand. Exploring the various features of the application allows users to familiarize themselves with the login and registration processes and provide valuable feedback for improvement.
